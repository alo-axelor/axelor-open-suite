title: "Fiscal position: changed the behavior of fiscal position on Purchase and Sale order"
type: fix
description: |
  Sale and Purchase Order: Refactor of the behavior for Fiscal Position, Currency and price list in Sale and Purchase Order in order to have the same behavior.

  Now the partner is filtered depending on the currency and price list which are readonly if there is an order line.
  The fiscal position is now editable even if there is an order line. Changing the partner updates the fiscal position and the taxes on lines.
